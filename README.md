# Turtle Crossing Game

A simple yet fun game where the player must navigate their way across the screen, avoiding oncoming cars. This project uses Python's Turtle graphics library to create a visual and interactive game.

## Features

-   **Player Movement:** The player can move forward to cross the screen.
-   **Car Generation:** Cars are generated at random intervals and move across the screen.
-   **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions between the player and the cars.
-   **Leveling Up:** The player levels up and the car speed increases each time the player successfully crosses the screen.

## How to Play

-   **Start the game:** Run the `crossing.py` script.
-   **Move the player:** Press the "Up" arrow key to move the player forward.
-   **Avoid cars:** Navigate through the oncoming cars to reach the other side.
-   **Level Up:** When you reach the top of the screen, you'll level up and the game will become more challenging as the car speed increases.
